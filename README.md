# Animal Locomotion
This project analyzes the locomotion of the basilisk lizard as part of the **2103322 Mechanics of Machinery** course at Chulalongkorn University. The primary objective of this study is to investigate the locomotion of the basilisk lizard and to represent it as a mechanical mechanism, specifically through the use of links connected by joints. Subsequently, we optimize the length of each link to match the specified walking profile.
